# Detour

//ToDo Images

## Description
Detour is an 11u keyboard with an angled top macro row. The board design was inspired from The Ave keyboard. The layout is based on the QAZ layout by tominabox1 and whydobearsxplod, with inspirations from the vault35 layout from MechVault.

The board can be built with a leaf-spring top mounted plate featuring three different levels of flex, or bottom mounted using the tabs on the PCB. The plate can be excluded from the PCB mounting configuration for a flexy plateless build.

A build guide for the Detour can be [found here](https://nachie.github.io/detour-build-guide/).
