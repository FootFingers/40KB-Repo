## Description
Alix 40 is a 40% Alice keyboard. Alix uses a plateless assembly in an acrylic case. It implements shock-absorbers on the PCB for mounting. The top and bottom parts of the case are milled acrylic, and dip-dyed by hand by Toya Senryo in Asakusa, Tokyo.

Alix uses a 0Â° typing angle and has support for both Bluetooth wireless and wired usage.  

From the IC: "[Alix] is hand-crafted in Tokyo by local craftsmen and designed to be niche". A video of the creation process is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G36aYIesauE&t=167s).

The Alix40 Group Buy was limited to 100 units, and sold out in 16 hours. It was sold through the [Tokyo Keyboard website](https://shop.tokyokeyboard.com/).
