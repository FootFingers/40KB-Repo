## Description
Curio is a 13u keyboard with an exploded spacebar dropped down by 0.25u. It utilizes a top-mount assembly design, milled acrylic case and aluminum weight.

Two 0.25u blockers were added to the bottom left and bottom right of the layout. The bottom right blocker is there to achieve the use of conventional arrow keys in the main cluster (something not typically available on a 13u board). The bottom left blocker was added to mimic the right side symmetrically and allow for modifier keys. As for the name Curio, the definition is: Of an object; something considered rare, unusual, or intriguing.

Two-piece top-mount case design with a 5Â° typing angle. Case top is CNC milled cast acrylic, bottom is CNC milled 6061 aluminum
