## Description
Le Chiffre (ironically, "the number" in French)

Arguably the most iconic 30% keyboard. The purpose of Le Chiffre was to provide a platform for MX and Choc ergo (Alps support too!) in one package for when ones wrists need a break.

Le Chiffre is open-source and [available here](https://github.com/tominabox1/Le-Chiffre-Keyboard).
